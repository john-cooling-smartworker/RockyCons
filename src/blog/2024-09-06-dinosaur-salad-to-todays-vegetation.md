title: Dinosaur Salad to Today's Vegetation
description: Did you know that plants have been leaving their mark on Earth's
  history since at least the Silurian period? Join Royal Geographical Society of
  Queensland and Dr Jennifer Cooling for our November lecture on a journey back
  in time as we delve into the world of palynomorphs – the microscopic fossils
  that hold the secrets of Queensland's past vegetation. From the extinction of
  the dinosaurs to the dawn of the Holocene, we're embarking on a journey of
  discovery.

Since at least the Silurian, plants have been shedding their spores and pollen into the environment to contribute their genes to the next generation of plants. Thanks to the incredible chemical resilience of the walls of these grains, and their conveniently small sizes, these palynomorphs are often incorporated into accumulating sediments. If these sedimentary records manage to survive to the present day, they can be sampled and those same palynomorphs can then be extracted for study.

We will be looking at what study of these microfossils can tell us about the past vegetation of Queensland, with a focus on the period between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the beginning of the Holocene.

Dr Jennifer Cooling is a casual academic at the University of Queensland. Having completed a PhD on the palynology of the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition of the northern Surat Basin (Queensland), she has since worked on a variety of younger material. This has included study of a ‘Tertiary’ aged channel deposit near Moranbah, as well as more modern material from the south-west Tasmanian World Heritage area, and Queensland channel country and central coast.
